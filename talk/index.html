                For non-linear random walks on the 2-torus, we study the regularity of stationary measures. Perturbing the generators of certain (Zariski dense) affine random walks,
                we show the only (ergodic) non-atomic stationary measure is absolutely continuous.
                In particular, there are no stationary measures of fractal dimension.  One can study the top Lyapunov exponent relative to the absolutely continuous stationary measure.
                Entropy considerations give an inequality between the top Lyapunov exponent for the non-linear and affine random walks.
                For random walks satisfying a cone condition, equality holds precisely when non-linear random walk is smoothly conjugate to an affine random walk.

                Wentao Fan established that the hyperbolicity (of the return to a suitable section) is uniform if the larger radius is large enough,

                Around 1980, David Ruelle considered an asymptotic expansion of the Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets of the quadratic
                family $ f_c(z) = z^2+c $ near $ c=0 $. In particular, Ruelle’s results states that $ H.dimJ_c = 1 + |c|^2/(2\log 2) + O(|c|^3) $ as $|c| \to 0 $.
                In this talk, we consider an analogue of this question for the family $ f_t(z,w)=(z^d,w^d+t(b_2(x)w^{d-2} + … + b_d(x))) $ of polynomial skew products of $CP^2$ near $t=0$.
                As holomorphic dynamical systems in higher dimensions are non-conformal, we replace Hausdorff dimension by volume dimension (that we introduced earlier) and consider its asymptotic expansion.

                Schrödinger operators with quasi-periodic potentials were intensively studied in the last few decades. Their spectral properties depend on the value of the coefficient in front of the potential, so called. coupling constant. For small values of the coupling constant the spectrum is absolutely continuous, while for large coupling constants the spectrum is pure point. Natural families of Schrödinger operators with quasi-periodic potentials appear in the context of the Aubry-Mather theory. In this setting there are no coupling constants. Instead operators depend on the nonlinearity parameter for related area-preserving maps. We shall discuss the transition from the absolutely continuous to the pure point spectrum for such families of Schrödinger operators.

The talk is based on a joint work with Artur Avila and Martin Leguil.

                I will begin with the classical setting of the modular surface: the unit tangent bundle of the modular curve $ T^1(SL(2,Z)\backslash H)=SL(2,Z)\backslash SL(2,R) $,
                where periodic geodesics correspond to periodic orbits of the diagonal subgroup. Margulis and Bowen established dynamical frameworks for
                studying these orbits, while Selberg and Sarnak developed spectral and number-theoretic approaches.
                We then turn to the higher-rank generalization, periodic diagonal orbits on $SL(3,Z)\backslash SL(3,R)$. In this case, each periodic diagonal orbit is
                a two-dimensional flat torus embedded in the space. Different counting problems emerge, depending on how one orders these tori--whether by dynamical ordering,
                geometric ordering or arithmetic ordering. The dynamical and geometric ordering are closely connected through the shapes of the flat tori.
                Finally, I will discuss my recent joint work with Thi Dang and Nihar Gargava on the density of shapes of periodic tori.

                either positive or zero viscosity. Under mild assumptions on the

                For a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism with 1-dimensional center, we introduce a counting function, which counts the disjoint preimages of
                unit disks on every unit unstable disk where the dynamics in the center direction are expanding or contracting. This function is semi-lower
                continuous with respect to the diffeomorphism, and is a lower bound of the supremum of the metric entropy of non-hyperbolic measures $ I(f) $.
                As an application, we can estimate a lower bound of the function $ I(f) $ for a $ C^{1} $ open and dense subset of $C^2$ volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
                with 1-dimensional center, and we are going to show that for a large family of $ C^{1} $ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, this lower bound is indeed sharp by
                considering the iterations. Several partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms are studied: partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with circle bundle; perturbation of
                the time-one map of hyperbolic geodesic ﬂows; some kind of derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms. A similar argument also shows that for a family of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ random
                matrices $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}$, this estimation is sharp for $ \theta \ne 0 $ sufficiently small, and
                in particular, $ I\ge 4\theta \log 2/\pi $. This talk is based on joint work with Lorenzo D&iacuteaz, Xiaodong Wang, and Jiagang Yang.

                the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions, and the first extension of Kac's program to the Landau equation in the soft potential regime.
                The convergence is established in weak, Wasserstein, and entropic senses,together with strong L1 convergence. To handle the singularity of soft potentials,
                we extend the duality approach of Bresch-Duerinckx-Jabin and establish key functional inequalities, including an extended commutator estimate and a new
                second-order Fisher information estimate. Based on a joint work with Xuanrui Feng (PKU).
