                For non-linear random walks on the 2-torus, we study the regularity of stationary measures. Perturbing the generators of certain (Zariski dense) affine random walks,
                we show the only (ergodic) non-atomic stationary measure is absolutely continuous.
                In particular, there are no stationary measures of fractal dimension.  One can study the top Lyapunov exponent relative to the absolutely continuous stationary measure.
                Entropy considerations give an inequality between the top Lyapunov exponent for the non-linear and affine random walks.
                For random walks satisfying a cone condition, equality holds precisely when non-linear random walk is smoothly conjugate to an affine random walk.

                These do not satisfy the usual criteria for hyperbolicity but have been known to be hyperbolic.
                Wentao Fan established that the hyperbolicity (of the return to a suitable section) is uniform if the larger radius is large enough,
                and that known conditions for (first local, then global) ergodicity and indeed mixing properties are satisfied.
                This includes control of singularity curves which in this case do not seem to fit the usual requirements:

                Around 1980, David Ruelle considered an asymptotic expansion of the Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets of the quadratic
                family $ f_c(z) = z^2+c $ near $ c=0 $. In particular, Ruelle’s results states that $ H.dimJ_c = 1 + |c|^2/(2\log 2) + O(|c|^3) $ as $|c| \to 0 $.
                In this talk, we consider an analogue of this question for the family $ f_t(z,w)=(z^d,w^d+t(b_2(x)w^{d-2} + … + b_d(x))) $ of polynomial skew products of $CP^2$ near $t=0$.
                As holomorphic dynamical systems in higher dimensions are non-conformal, we replace Hausdorff dimension by volume dimension (that we introduced earlier) and consider its asymptotic expansion.

                Schrödinger operators with quasi-periodic potentials were intensively studied in the last few decades. Their spectral properties depend on the value of the coefficient in front of the potential, so called. coupling constant. For small values of the coupling constant the spectrum is absolutely continuous, while for large coupling constants the spectrum is pure point. Natural families of Schrödinger operators with quasi-periodic potentials appear in the context of the Aubry-Mather theory. In this setting there are no coupling constants. Instead operators depend on the nonlinearity parameter for related area-preserving maps. We shall discuss the transition from the absolutely continuous to the pure point spectrum for such families of Schrödinger operators.

The talk is based on a joint work with Artur Avila and Martin Leguil.

                In chaotic systems, the mixing property is known for the fast decay of correlation. It is called rapid mixing if the correlation function decays super-polynomially.
                The mixing mechanism for hyperbolic systems and its compact group extensions were studied by Dolgopyat in a series of his papers in the late 90s'. In this talk, we prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m\geq 2$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show m = 2 suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in Dolgopyat ('02) about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.

This is joint work with Dmitry Dolgopyat and Spencer Durham.

                I will begin with the classical setting of the modular surface: the unit tangent bundle of the modular curve $ T^1(SL(2,Z)\backslash H)=SL(2,Z)\backslash SL(2,R) $,
                where periodic geodesics correspond to periodic orbits of the diagonal subgroup. Margulis and Bowen established dynamical frameworks for
                studying these orbits, while Selberg and Sarnak developed spectral and number-theoretic approaches.
                We then turn to the higher-rank generalization, periodic diagonal orbits on $SL(3,Z)\backslash SL(3,R)$. In this case, each periodic diagonal orbit is
                a two-dimensional flat torus embedded in the space. Different counting problems emerge, depending on how one orders these tori--whether by dynamical ordering,
                geometric ordering or arithmetic ordering. The dynamical and geometric ordering are closely connected through the shapes of the flat tori.
                Finally, I will discuss my recent joint work with Thi Dang and Nihar Gargava on the density of shapes of periodic tori.

                line, forced by a white-in-time, color-in-space homogeneous noise, with
                either positive or zero viscosity. Under mild assumptions on the
                forcing, we establish that for every fixed average velocity, a unique
                ergodic solution exists and the One Force --- One Solution principle
                holds. Moreover, in the inviscid limit the positive viscosity ergodic

                solution problem can be reformulated in terms of the existence of the
                infinite-volume and zero-temperature limits of the polymer measures.

                dimensions and for general non-quadratic Hamiltonians, as well as the
                connection to KPZ universality.

                For a partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphism with 1-dimensional center, we introduce a counting function, which counts the disjoint preimages of
                unit disks on every unit unstable disk where the dynamics in the center direction are expanding or contracting. This function is semi-lower
                continuous with respect to the diffeomorphism, and is a lower bound of the supremum of the metric entropy of non-hyperbolic measures $ I(f) $.
                As an application, we can estimate a lower bound of the function $ I(f) $ for a $ C^{1} $ open and dense subset of $C^2$ volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
                with 1-dimensional center, and we are going to show that for a large family of $ C^{1} $ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, this lower bound is indeed sharp by
                considering the iterations. Several partially hyperbolic diﬀeomorphisms are studied: partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with circle bundle; perturbation of
                the time-one map of hyperbolic geodesic ﬂows; some kind of derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms. A similar argument also shows that for a family of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ random
                matrices $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}$, this estimation is sharp for $ \theta \ne 0 $ sufficiently small, and
                in particular, $ I\ge 4\theta \log 2/\pi $. This talk is based on joint work with Lorenzo D&iacuteaz, Xiaodong Wang, and Jiagang Yang.

                obtained by passing to the grazing limit on Kac's walk in his program for the Boltzmann equation. Our result covers the full range of interaction potentials,
                including the physically important Coulomb case. This provides the first resolution of propagation of chaos for a many-particle system approximating
                the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions, and the first extension of Kac's program to the Landau equation in the soft potential regime.
                The convergence is established in weak, Wasserstein, and entropic senses,together with strong L1 convergence. To handle the singularity of soft potentials,
                we extend the duality approach of Bresch-Duerinckx-Jabin and establish key functional inequalities, including an extended commutator estimate and a new
                second-order Fisher information estimate. Based on a joint work with Xuanrui Feng (PKU).

                In either billiards for Riemannian manifolds, the marked length spectrum rigidity asks whether the lengths of all periodic orbits marked by their homotopy type is enough to determine the geometry.  We will show that for generic analytic billiards, having the same marked length spectrum implies the billiard maps are symplectically analytically conjugate on the neighborhood of a Cantor hyperbolic set. In the special case that the billiard are $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric, then the billiards are isometric. This is based on a joint work with V. Kaloshin and M. Leguil.

                In 2016, Bunimovich, Zhang, Zhang pioneered the study of Asymmetric Lemon Billiards' hyperbolicity. The current talk will come across the earlier results by Bunimovich, Hong-kun Zhang, Xin Jin and Pengfei Zhang. In their found/proved Wojtkowski invariant cone and conclusions, with the tools by Chernov and Markarian, it will be shown there is a uniform expansion for the Lemon Billiard section return map. And given the uniform expansion and new conclusions, the return map singularity curves satisfy the conditions of local ergodicity. Based on the previous local ergodic theorem by Sinai-Chernov, Liverani-Wojtkowski and Del Magno-Markarian, we further obtain the ergodicity of the lemon billiard map.

                Let $\mu_{\lambda}$ be the Bernoulli convolution measure with parameter $\lambda\in(0,1)$. We prove that $h=h_{\phi}:\lambda\mapsto \int_{\mathbb{R}}\phi(x)\,d\mu_{\lambda}(x)$ is differentiable almost every $\lambda \in (2^{-\frac{1}{3}}+\epsilon,1)$ and for H$\ddot{o}$lder continuous observable $\phi$ with sufficiently large H$\ddot{o}$lder exponent. In contrast, we also show if $\dim \mu_{\lambda}<1$ then there exists H$\ddot{o}$lder observable with H$\ddot{o}$lder exponent arbitrarily close to $1$, so that $h_\phi$ is not differentiable at $\lambda$.

                We study outer billiard systems around a class of circular sectors.
For semi-discs, we prove the existence of elliptic islands occupying a positive proportion of the plane. Combined with known results, this shows the coexistence of stability and diffusion for this system. On the other hand, we show that there exists a countable family of circular sectors
for which the outer billiard system has zero measure of escaping orbits.

                In this talk, we will discuss $r$-neutralized local entropy and $r$-neutralized 
entropy. We first review some background on measures of maximal entropy, measures of maximal Hausdorff dimension, and neutralized entropy. We obtain formulas for the $r$neutralized local entropy in smooth systems. In particular, for certain hyperbolic systems, we prove the existence of ergodic measures that maximize the $r$-neutralized entropy. This is based on joint work with Changguang Dong.

                We partially extend the Ledrappier-Young entropy formula to invariant measures of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting. We prove that for any ergodic measure with dominated splitting, if the i-th Lyapunov exponent has multiplicity one, then the i-th transverse entropy is equal to the product of the i-th Lyapunov exponent and transverse measure dimension. Moreover, if we further assume that every intermediate non-negative Lyapunov exponents have multiplicity one, we can establish the full Ledrappier-Young entropy formula. This relaxes the classical $C^2$ regularity assumption to $C^1$ in the remarkable work by Ledrappier and Young under these one-dimensional assumptions. 
As a consequence, the Avila–Viana invariance principle holds when the center is one-dimensional. We also derive $C^1$ versions of numerous fundamental results in measure dimension theory, including the famous works by Ledrappier-Young, Barreira-Pesin- Schmeling, and Ledrappier-Xie. This is joint work with Shaobo Gan and Jiagang Yang.
