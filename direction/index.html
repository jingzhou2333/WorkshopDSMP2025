    <h2>
        Practical Info
    </h2>
    <p>
        The December weather in Dongguan is roughly 10 - 18 degrees in Celsius, not much rain. You may check the most up-to-date weather info before travel and pack accordingly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It is strongly recommended that you have Chinese electronic payment Apps (such as Alipay or Wechat Pay) ready on your phone, as people in China nowadays seldom use cash and you may run into difficulty getting change if you pay in cash.
